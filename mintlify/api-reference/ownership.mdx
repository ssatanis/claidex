## Get ownership chain

`GET /v1/ownership/:npi`

Returns the ownership chain for a provider: the API resolves the provider’s name to matching **CorporateEntity** nodes (e.g. SNF), then traverses **OWNS** edges up to 5 levels. Response is an array of ownership levels (depth, owner, relationship).

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `npi` | string | 10-digit NPI. |

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "npi": "1316250707",
    "levels": [
      {
        "depth": 1,
        "owner": { "entity_id", "name", "entityType", ... },
        "relationship": "OWNS"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": { "source", "query_time_ms" }
}
```

Levels are ordered by depth. The graph has no direct Provider→CorporateEntity edge; resolution is by name match (case-insensitive) on SNF (or other) entities.

### Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | Success (chain may be empty). |
| 404 | Provider not found in graph. |
| 422 | Invalid NPI format. |
