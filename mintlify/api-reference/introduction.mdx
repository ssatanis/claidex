title: API introduction
description: REST API overview, base URL, and conventions
---

## Base URL

- **Local:** `http://localhost:4001` (or `PORT` from `.env`)
- **Production:** Set by deployment (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)

All documented endpoints are under the **v1** prefix: `/v1/*`.

## Conventions

- **Method:** REST; primary methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` as appropriate.
- **Response shape:** Successful JSON responses use `{ "data": ..., "meta": { ... } }`. Paginated lists include `meta` with counts or cursor info. Errors use HTTP status codes and a consistent error body.
- **IDs:** Provider lookups use 10-digit **NPI**. Entity lookups use internal IDs or CMS associate IDs as defined per endpoint.
- **Rate limiting:** Applied to `/v1/*`. Health endpoints (`/health`, `/v1/health`) are not rate-limited.

## Health

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /health` | Orchestrator health; returns 200 when Postgres and Neo4j are connected. |
| `GET /v1/health` | Same check with `status`, `postgres`, `neo4j`, `uptime_seconds`. |

## Versioning

The current API version is **v1**. Breaking changes will be introduced under a new version path (e.g. `/v2/`). Non-breaking additions (new fields, new endpoints) may be made within v1.
