title: Authentication
description: API keys and session-based access
---

## Overview

- **Public endpoints** (e.g. provider lookup, search, exclusions) may be called without authentication, subject to rate limits.
- **Account endpoints** under `/v1/me` (profile, API keys, organization, watchlists, export) require a valid session or API key.

## Session (browser)

When using the frontend, the app manages sessions (e.g. cookie or token). The API validates the session and returns the current user for `GET /v1/me` and allows mutations (PATCH profile, API keys, organization, watchlist) when authenticated.

## API keys

For server-to-server or script access:

1. Authenticate via the app (or existing auth flow) and open **Settings** or **API keys**.
2. Create an API key. Store the secret securely; it may not be shown again.
3. Send the key in the request:

**Header (recommended):**

```
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

**Query (alternative, if supported):**

```
?api_key=<api_key>
```

Keys can be revoked from the same settings. Do not commit keys to source control or expose them in client-side code.

## Scopes (future)

Future versions may support scoped API keys (e.g. read-only providers, read/write watchlists). Current keys have full access to the authenticated user’s account endpoints.
