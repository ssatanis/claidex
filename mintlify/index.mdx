## Platform overview

Claidex is a **three-tier** data platform:

```
Data sources → ETL (ingest / transform / load) → Postgres + Neo4j → REST API → Frontend
```

- **Postgres**: Relational data — providers, payments, exclusions, risk scores. Full-text search over provider names and NPI.
- **Neo4j**: Graph data — providers, corporate entities, persons, exclusions; edges for ownership, payments, and exclusions.
- **REST API**: TypeScript/Express at `/v1/*`. Rate-limited, CORS-configured, health-checked.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19; dashboard, provider detail, watchlists, events, settings.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **NPI** | 10-digit National Provider Identifier; primary key for providers. |
| **Peer group** | Providers sharing taxonomy (10-char) and state; used for risk calibration. |
| **Ownership chain** | CorporateEntity nodes connected by `OWNS` (up to 5 hops); SNF-focused. |
| **LEIE** | List of Excluded Individuals/Entities; exclusion status and reinstatement. |
